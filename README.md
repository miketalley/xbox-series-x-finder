# XBox Series X Finder
Your prayers have been answered, maybe. Just run this baby and turn the sound on your computer up!

UPDATE: Now supports PS5 and Xbox Series S searches!

The app prompts for the console you are looking for, your zip code, and search radius. Then it continually checks the inventory of local Target and Gamestop stores until a store with inventory has been found. A notification sound will play and the store location will be displayed when found.

### Current Console Searches Supported
- Xbox Series X
- Xbox Series S
- Playstation 5

### Running It
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run start` to start the script
