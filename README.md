# XBox Series X Finder
Your prayers have been answered, maybe. Just run this baby and turn the sound on your computer up!

The app prompts for the console you are looking for, your zip code, and search radius. Then it continually checks the inventory of local Target and Gamestop stores until a store with inventory has been found. A notification sound will play and the store location will be displayed when found.

### Current Console Searches Supported
- Xbox Series X
- Xbox Series S
- Playstation 5

### Running It
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run start` to start the script
